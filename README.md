# Wells

Semester-long project in CS307: Object Oriented Programming in C++.

The project focuses on creating a simulation program for Oil Wells. The project was split up into three seperate parts, programming assignments 1, 2, and 3. The first estabilished a structure for the program using basic object-oriented concepts. The next introduced various design patterns, and the final assignment involved creating a MFC GUI application to visualize the data.

The requirements for each programming assignment are found in the base folder of the repository.
